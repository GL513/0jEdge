# Custom Orange and Black themes for ALOT of UI/GUI/UX
* Just so you know, I'm currently working on communications to report issues, file branches, etc.
* I am SLOWLY uploading all of my themes, from Chromium to Telegram... It's gonna be a blast. 
* Telegram (Non-TGX) is currently a work in progress, so if you've figured out a var that needs a color, let me know.
* Telegram-X is nearly complete, just... theres one issue with some window menus.
* Screenshots coming soon...
